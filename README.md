# Building a PostgreSQL database


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main goal of this project is creating a database to store data about books, book rates and users. 

So, in this project I create a database named booksdb and 3 different tables (books_info, ratings_info and users_info) with appropriate datatypes for storing the data from the csv files ("archive" folder).
Also, I build a simple data model to illustrate the data used and stored within the system and the relationships among them.  

Briefly, I cover these following aspects of managing databases with Postgres:
* How to create a database;
* How to create database schemas and tables with the proper datatypes;
* How to load data from CSV files into database tables.
